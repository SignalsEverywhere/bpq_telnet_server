# bpq_telnet_server
A Python powered telnet server intended to be used with BPQ packet radio software to easily extend services offered.

# BPQ and Packet?
BPQ is an application used by amateur radio operators to send packets or digital data back and forth among many stations.

# Why a telnet server?
BPQ has an option allowing you to connect to a telnet server to provide additional functionality when an operator signs into a packet radio node. Thus with a extendable telnet server we can easily add features for our nodes.

# Why python?
First and foremore because I know it better than other languages, another good reason is that it's easy to work with, beginner friendly and very well documented. I feel like this is the best route to easily allow people to add functionality to their bpq node.

# So What State is This in?
Currently, I've just now open sourced the code which is EXTREMELY BASIC however I plan to refine it and make it much more modular as well as pull data from a proper configuration file rather than hard coding everything.
